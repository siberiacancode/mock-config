description: Learn the essential CLI commands for working with mock-config
---

### Overview

The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides two main commands to help you quickly scaffold and run mock servers for your projects.

### Commands

- **[`mcs init`](./init)** — Create a mock configuration. Generates a `.mock-config.ts` (or `.js`) file with a config template and sample request examples. Choose your language (TypeScript or JavaScript), select an API type (REST, GraphQL, or both), and configure basic server settings.

- **[`mcs run`](./run)** — Start a mock server. Runs a mock server using your configuration file with optional CLI arguments to override config values.

### Quick Start

Get started in seconds:

```bash
# Create a new mock project
npx mcs init

# Start the mock server
npx mcs run
```

Both commands are designed to be simple and straightforward. If you're new — begin with `init` to scaffold your first project, then use `run` to start the server.
