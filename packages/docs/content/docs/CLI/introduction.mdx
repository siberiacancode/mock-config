### Usage

Get started in seconds:

```bash
# Create a new mock project
npx mcs init

# Start the mock server
npx mcs run
```

Start with `init` to scaffold your first project, then use `run` to launch the server. Both commands come with built-in validation to ensure your configuration is correct and help you avoid common mistakes.
