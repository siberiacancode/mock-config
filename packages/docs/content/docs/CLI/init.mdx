title: Init
description: Create a new mock template using the `mock-config` CLI
---

### Overview

`mcs init` — Create a project template. It scaffolds a new mock-config project in the current directory with a config file and sample request examples. It runs an interactive flow that lets you choose TypeScript vs JavaScript, select an API sample (REST, GraphQL or both), and set basic server options like base URL, port and static path.

### Using

`mcs init`

### Interactive flow

The command asks a few short questions:

- `Would you like to use TypeScript?` — toggle (Yes / No).
- `Choose api type` — select: `rest`, `graphql`, or `full` (both).
- `Base url` — text (must start with `/`).
- `Port` — number.
- `Static path` — text (must start with `/`).\n\n### Using\n:`mcs init`
