title: Init
description: Create a new mock template
---

### Overview

`mcs init` — Create a mock configuration. It generates a `.mock-config.ts` (or `.js`) file with a config template and sample request examples in the current directory. An interactive flow lets you choose TypeScript vs JavaScript, select an API type (REST, GraphQL or both), and set basic server options like base URL, port and static path.

### Using

```bash
npx mcs init
```

### Interactive flow

The command asks a few short questions:

- `Would you like to use TypeScript?` — toggle (Yes / No).
- `Choose api type` — select: `rest`, `graphql`, or `full` (both).
- `Base url` — text (must start with `/`).
- `Port` — number.
- `Static path` — text (must start with `/`).
