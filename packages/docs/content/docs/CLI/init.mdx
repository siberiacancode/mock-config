`mcs init` — Create a mock configuration. It generates a `.mock-server.config.(js|ts)` file with a config template and sample request examples in the current directory. An interactive flow lets you choose between TypeScript and JavaScript, select an API type (REST, GraphQL or both), and set basic server options like baseURL, port and staticPath.

### Usage

```bash
npx mcs init
```

### Interactive flow

The command asks a few short questions:

- `Would you like to use TypeScript?` (toggle): choose whether to generate a TypeScript or JavaScript configuration file.
- `Choose api type` (select): select the type of API to generate mock examples for. Options: `Rest`, `GraphQL`, or `Both`.
- `Base url` (string): set the base URL path for the mock server. Must start with `/`. Default: `/`.
- `Port` (number): set the port number for the mock server. Default: `31299`.
- `Static path` (string): set the static assets path for the mock server. Must start with `/`. Default: `/`.
