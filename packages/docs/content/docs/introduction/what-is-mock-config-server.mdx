Mock Config Server is a tool that, easily, quickly simulates the server behavior. The main difference from solutions such as [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and [mock-service-worker](https://mswjs.io/) is the ease of filling in data and flexible emulation of any and usual cases.

## Philosophy

### Simplicity

We obsess over the things that steal time from shipping. Mock Config keeps the developer experience fast and predictable: concise configuration, sensible defaults, and composable primitives. This lets you focus on the scenarios, not the setup.

### Flexibility

Production systems are often complex, but creating mocks shouldn’t be. Mock Config lets you combine predefined responses with dynamically generated data, define response sequences, and tailor replies based on request context. It works equally well for local development, component-level testing, and building fully staged end-to-end scenarios.

### Transparency

Mocks shouldn’t be a black box. Mock Config makes it easy to see why a response was returned: what data was generated, and how the request was processed. You can log requests and responses and inspect how scenarios are evaluated to better understand behavior, troubleshoot issues, and trust your mocks.
