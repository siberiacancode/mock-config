### Mock smarter, not harder.

**Mock Config Server** is built around one simple idea — mocking should feel as natural as writing your app.  
No boilerplate, no setup pain — just a clear, predictable system that helps you build and test faster.

### What we believe in

- **Simplicity** — configuration should be obvious. Define your mock once and get results instantly.
- **Flexibility** — serve REST, GraphQL, or static data in any shape you need. Extend or customize when required.
- **Predictability** — what you configure is exactly what you get. No hidden behavior, no surprises.

### Flat config

It’s easy to read, combine, and share — keeping your mock environment consistent and maintainable.

### The goal

To create a tool that feels lightweight yet powerful —  
something you can drop into any project and get an instant, reliable mock server without breaking your flow.
