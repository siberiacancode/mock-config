title: What is mock-config
description: A data mocking tool built to fit your workflow, not the other way around.
---

Mock Config puts you in complete control of your application’s network behavior.
Simulate slow APIs, generate edge-case data, or stage complete backend flows — all without writing production code.

It supports REST, GraphQL and WebSocket endpoints, and pairs easily with test runners, CI
pipelines, and local development servers.

- Need to cover multiple scenarios or dynamically adjust requests and responses? — You can.
- Want to simulate CORS behavior? — You can.
- Need to emulate database operations and entity logic? — You can.

## Philosophy

### Simplicity

We obsess over the things that steal time from shipping. Mock Config strives to keep the
developer experience short and predictable: concise configuration, sensible defaults, and
composable primitives so you can focus on the scenarios, not the setup.

<hr />

### Flexibility

Production systems are often complex, but creating mocks shouldn’t be. Mock Config lets you combine predefined responses with dynamically generated data, define response sequences, and tailor replies based on request context. It works equally well for local development, component-level testing, and building fully staged end-to-end scenarios.

<hr />

### Transparency

Mocks shouldn’t be a black box. Mock Config should make it easy to see why a response was returned: which rule matched, what data was generated, and how the request was processed. You can log requests and responses and inspect how scenarios are evaluated to better understand behavior, troubleshoot issues, and trust your mocks.
